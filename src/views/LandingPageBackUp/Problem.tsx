            Online Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse or OCSEA involves the use
            of information and communication technology as a means to sexually
            abuse and/or sexually exploit children. Online predators use
            multiple techniques, starting from grooming to exploitation, to lure
            children to create and disseminate lewd contents online in exchange
            of valuable things. In addition, children inadvertently upload their
            sexual contents to the internet themselves so as to gain recognition
            or popularity, leading to unexpected outcome. As a result, it is
            necessary to educate and train children to be well aware of this
            threat by developing new educational tools that are enjoyable,
            measurable and attainable.
